# Electoral calling
The fate of the country is in the hands of these 538 members of the
electoral college. Here's who they are.

This project is a JavaScript application built with the
[choo framework](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo). The data
powering it is stored in a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CHvGdLNmk4ltaX2E_2uDEVSomS5IUVhVDp5RvTu7FbQ/edit?usp=sharing)
which is fetched at every page load using [tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop).
